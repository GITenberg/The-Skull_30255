description: <p>Conger is given a chance to be released from prison on the condition
  that he completes one job--he must travel back in time and kill a man who, if allowed
  to live, will later change the world. </p><p>Philip K. Dick was an American science-fiction
  novelist, short-story writer and essayist. His first short story, "Beyond Lies the
  Wub," was published shortly after his high school graduation. Some of his most famous
  short stories were adapted for film, including "The Minority Report," "Paycheck,"
  "Second Variety" (adapted into the film <em>Screamers</em>) and "We Can Remember
  It For You Wholesale" (adapted into the film <em>Total Recall</em>).</p><p>HarperCollins
